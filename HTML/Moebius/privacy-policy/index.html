		<h2>Moebius Data Collection and Privacy Policy</h2>
		<h3>In Brief:</h3>
		At Endless Now Productions, we want to be fully transparent with the users of our applications.<br>
		The only data collected and stored by Moebius is data that can be considered "publicly available". Moebius currently only processes users' Discord ID numbers 
		and display names.
		<h3>Data Collected:</h3>
		Moebius collects only what is necessary for the application to properly function. In addition to a user's Discord User ID, their global display name is also collected. 
		Both pieces of information collected by Moebius are considered public information, as any individual can have this information collected by another user in the event that 
		the two are friends or have both joined the same Discord server. All data is stored within a private, password-protected database that can only be accessed from the IP of 
		the physical machine hosting Moebius. Data within the database is not sold or sent outside of the database for any reason, with the exception of a user's global display name, 
		which is used to insert their prefered name into command interactions.
		<h3>Data Usage:</h3>
		Data collected by Moebius is used exclusively to ensure that all features of the application are fully functional. Below is a broken-down explanation of each collected 
		item and why it is collected:<br><br>
		<u>Discord User ID</u> - Used to give each unique user a unique balance and inventory within Moebius's economy system.<br>
		<u>Global Display Name</u> - Used to refer to a user, without using their username, which is entirely lowercase.
