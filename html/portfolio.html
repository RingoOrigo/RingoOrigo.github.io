                    <p><a href = "https://github.com/RingoOrigo/Moebius-JS" target="_blank">Moebius-JS</a> is a complete 
                        rewrite of the original <a href = "https://github.com/RingoOrigo/moebius-bot" target = "_blank">Moebius</a>
                        project using discord.js, a Node.js module for Discord bots. The JS version of Moebius implements several
                        new features and improvements over the original Python version. While both versions support Discord's
                        improved interaction system (slash commands), the JS version boasts faster runtimes as well as a unique
                        economy system via a persistant database. Both versions of Moebius are open-source and hosted on my
                        GitHub profile. Specifically, Moebius-JS has fully instructions on how to set up and run the bot on your
                        local machine, as well as how to properly contribute to the project.

                        (XC3C) was the final project for my Android Development course during my senior year of high school. While
                        originally intended to be a simple app to earn a good grade, it quickly became a passion project of mine and has
                        become a fully fledged Android app. Allowing users to track their progress through the Xenoblade Chronicles 3
                        video game, XC3C makes use of Firebase to provide a proper login system and cloud storage to save user
                        progress and sync it across several devices. Although the app has not received an update in quite some time,
                        I have plans to revisit it and apply the skills I have learned since starting the project to improve it and add DLC support.
                        Look forward to an XC3CR (rewrite) branch in the future!

                         is a unique solution to a niche problem that I found myself having. Although the repository is archived, and the
                         program no longer works, I mention this project to highlight my problem solving skills and showcase a more
                         <i>unique</i> usage of Python's Selenium package. VRCAU served the singular purpose of unfriending VRChat
                         users in bulk, as I had found my friends list quickly ballooned to well over 600 people that I knew nothing about.
                         In order to do so, VRCAU opened a browser window, logged into the provided VRChat account, and began
                         navigating through HTML divs to find the unfriend button on every user that was not selected to stay. I find it to
                         showcase a unique usage of programming to automate simple, but repetitive, tasks.
