                    <p>I am always available via <a href = "mailto:nathaniel.t.wasko@gmail.com">e-mail</a> for casual or busines communication.
                        Please use a descriptive subject line to ensure your message is not lost in my inbox. <br>If you wish to communicate
                        professionally, you can also connect with me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/n-ringo-wasko">LinkedIn</a>.
                        <br> For more casual communication, I am also available on <a href = "https://discord.com/user/547101541442650133"> Discord</a>. 
                        If you send me a friend request, more likely than not I will accept before asking you why you reached out. <br> My 
                        <a href = "https://x.com/RingoOrigo">Twitter/X</a> is also a fine way to casually get in touch with me.

                    <p>Aside from <a href = "https://discord.com/user/547101541442650133"> Discord</a>, I am rarely active on 
                        social media, only using <a href = "https://x.com/RingoOrigo">Twitter/X</a> for the occasional joke. 
                        If you are interested in following me on various platforms, <a href = "https://instagram.com/ringoorigo">Instagram</a>
                        is private, but I may accept follow requests. <br> If I have an account on a platform, it is under the username Ringo Origo 
                        (with or without the space/capital letters, depending on platform allowances).

                    <p>My social media accounts under the Ringo Origo name are <i>personal</i> and <i>not</i> professional. Some
                        responses may be more formal and thought out than others, but that is not the purpose of these accounts.
                        <br> Platforms containing my legal name are professional and can be more reliably used for business inquiries.
