                    <h2>[R]ingo origo</h2>
                    <p> I am currently 20 years old and use any pronouns.  I am a college student, programmer, and avid fan of RPG video games such as the Xenoblade Chronicles
                        series, NieR series, and the Persona series. I frequently develop different personal websites, such as this, basing their designs off of video game UI's
                        for extra practice. My recreation of the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 title screen is still up on my Neocities!

                    <h2>ed[U]cation</h2>
                    <p> I am currently a sophomore student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I study Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
                        and Data. I am considering adding a dual major in Mathematics and a minor in Economics. I have taken multiple high level classes such as Linear Algebra, and
                        am looking forward to taking Computation Vision, Machine Learning From Data, and Data Mining.

                    <h2>pro[J]ects</h2>
                    <p> I have, and continue to work on, a variety of projects. I have created several personal websites, a Discord bot (Moebius), and various programs meant to solve
                        niche problems that I find myself having. Furthermore, I have developed an Android mobile app meant to interface with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, allowing the user
                        to view and track information about the game's enemies, characters, and quests. For more information, please visit my GitHub and view my pinned "Xenoblade Chronicles
                        3 Companion" repository.<br>Moebius, as mentioned above, is a Discord bot that I developed. Although it is still incomplete and has not received an update in a 
                        long period of time, Moebius is a functional variety bot meant to serve the purpose of "spicing up" a Discord server. Though I have stopped hosting it, feel free
                        to host it yourself with source code from the "Moebius-JS" GitHub repository.
